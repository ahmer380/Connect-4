# 1P/2P Connect 4 Game: Archived from June 2023

## Retrospective review notes taken from [my personal website](https://ahmeralam.co.uk/) (2024)
*The objective behind this project was to create a Connect 4 game that could be played by either one or two players. The game was implemented in Java, with a graphical user interface (GUI) designed using JavaFX (enhanced via CSS). The game features a simple yet intuitive interface, enabling players to take turns dropping personalised coloured discs into a grid.*

*The A.I's logic was implemented via the minimax algorithm, whereas inheritence and interfaces was utilised in order to seamlessly transition from 1P to 2P mechanics. This project was an excellent opportunity to showcase my Object-Oriented Programming skills acquired from previous Java related projects, as well as my prior experience with classical artificial intelligence algorithms.*
